## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Security Features

### Cryptographic Implementation
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2-SHA256 with 100,000+ iterations
- **Random Number Generation**: Cryptographically secure system RNG
- **Authentication**: Built-in authenticated encryption with GCM mode
- **Key Size**: 256-bit encryption keys
- **IV/Nonce**: 96-bit randomly generated per encryption
- **Salt**: 128-bit randomly generated per encryption
- **Authentication Tag**: 128-bit for integrity verification

### Security Guarantees
‚úÖ **Confidentiality**: Data is protected with AES-256 encryption  
‚úÖ **Integrity**: GCM mode provides authenticated encryption  
‚úÖ **Authenticity**: Authentication tags prevent tampering  
‚úÖ **Semantic Security**: Random IV ensures identical plaintexts produce different ciphertexts  
‚úÖ **Key Stretching**: PBKDF2 makes brute force attacks computationally expensive

## Security Best Practices

### Password Security
- **Minimum Length**: 12+ characters
- **Complexity**: Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- **Uniqueness**: Don't reuse passwords across systems
- **Storage**: Use environment variables or secure key management
- **Rotation**: Regularly update encryption passwords

### Implementation Security
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Good - Strong password from environment
const password = process.env.ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD;

// ‚ùå Bad - Hardcoded password
const password = 'simple123';
```

```python
# ‚úÖ Good - High iteration count
options = {'iterations': 150000}
encrypted = MaatCrossLangCrypto.encrypt(data, password, options)

# ‚ùå Bad - Low iteration count
options = {'iterations': 1000}  # Too low for production
```

```php
// ‚úÖ Good - Secure password handling
$password = $_ENV['ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD'];
if (!$password) {
    throw new Exception('Encryption password not configured');
}

// ‚ùå Bad - Password in source code
$password = 'hardcoded-password';
```

### Data Handling
- **Never log passwords** or encrypted data
- **Clear sensitive data** from memory when possible
- **Use HTTPS** for data transmission
- **Validate input** before encryption/decryption
- **Handle errors securely** (don't leak information)

### Production Configuration
```javascript
// Recommended production settings
const productionOptions = {
    iterations: 150000,    // Higher for production
    keyLength: 32,         // AES-256
    ivLength: 12,          // Standard for GCM
    saltLength: 16,        // 128-bit salt
    tagLength: 16          // 128-bit auth tag
};
```

## Known Security Considerations

### Timing Attacks
- PBKDF2 execution time varies with iteration count
- Consider constant-time comparison for password verification
- Monitor for timing-based side channels in your application

### Memory Security
- Passwords and keys may remain in memory after use
- Consider memory-clearing techniques for high-security applications
- Use secure memory allocation where available

### Implementation Vulnerabilities
- **Always validate** encrypted data format before processing
- **Check authentication tags** before decrypting
- **Handle exceptions** securely (don't leak crypto state)

## Security Testing

### Test Vectors
We provide comprehensive test vectors to validate implementations:
```bash
# Validate your implementation
npm run test:security
python tests/security_tests.py  
php tests/security-tests.php
```

### Fuzzing
Consider fuzzing your integration:
```javascript
// Example fuzzing test
for (let i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
    const randomData = generateRandomData();
    try {
        const encrypted = MaatCrossLangCrypto.encrypt(randomData, password);
        const decrypted = MaatCrossLangCrypto.decrypt(encrypted, password);
        assert(decrypted === randomData);
    } catch (e) {
        // Expected for invalid inputs
    }
}
```

### Penetration Testing
- Test with malformed encrypted data
- Verify error handling doesn't leak information  
- Test with various password strengths
- Validate cross-language compatibility edge cases

## Compliance

### Standards Compliance
- **FIPS 140-2**: Uses approved cryptographic algorithms
- **NIST**: Follows NIST recommendations for key derivation
- **OWASP**: Implements OWASP cryptographic guidelines

### Industry Standards  
- **PCI DSS**: Suitable for payment card data encryption
- **HIPAA**: Appropriate for healthcare data protection
